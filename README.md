# [IPND] Stage 2: MapleStory Trivia Quiz
[IPND] Stage 2: Code Your Own Quiz

## Stage 2 Details
In this stage, I used the Python programming language to build my own quiz. I used a fill-in-the blank style to create a quiz that can be used to ascertain how big of a MapleStory fan each player is.

## Stage 2 Rubric Objectives
### Game Basics

- Game has 3 or more levels and each level contains 4 or more blanks to fill in

### Beginning the Game

- Immediately after running the program, user is prompted to select a difficulty level from easy / medium / hard
- Once a level is selected, game displays a fill-in-the-blank and a prompt to fill in the first blank.

### Game Play

- When player guesses correctly, new prompt shows with correct answer in the previous blank and a new prompt for the next blank.
- When player guesses incorrectly, they are prompted to try again.

## Additions Beyond Objectives

- Let players decide how many wrong guesses they can make before they lose.
- Let players decide if they wish to try another level.
